## Description of the Project (300 words)
Trading is currently an emerging field be it Stocks, Crypto or any other equity, and has a very high influx. To the extent of its popularity, the trading field is filled with numerous jargons and a plethora of complicated procedures. It takes almost 2 years for a hard-working trader to see the light of success, this leads to a lot of part-time/hobby traders to give up easily. Finformant is here to change this! We want to give everyone the resources and real time updates so that they can be always on their best game. 

Starting with our Newsletters which are condensed information from top websites, reports and more. With our Newsletters, we aim to give our users a channel in which they can get real time updates from different sources and at the same time, give a condensed form to make it more time efficient. A community is very important for building upcoming traders, we provide a premium community feature where the user can join any of the available community or create their own community and customize the community to fit their requirements. The users can also send direct messages to other users in the community.

To top it all, a good advisor can easily boost your trading career and fast track you to success. Finformant provides you with an Advisor recommendation feature, through which you can seek help from other successful traders. Learn from the best to beat the best. In a nutshell, Finformant not only helps professional traders to keep track of their transactions but also help beginners to master their trading skill.
